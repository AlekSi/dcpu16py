A Python implementation of Notch's DCPU-16.

See http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt for specification.

Notch apparently started doing a 6502 emulator first. Given I did one in
Python <https://github.com/jtauber/applepy> it only seems fitting I now
do a DCPU-16 implementation in Python too :-)

STATUS

Runs the example program successfully. Cycle times are not yet taken
into account but it otherwise should be feature-complete.

I plan to work on an assembler next and possibly a Forth implementation.

I'm also keen to find out how Notch plans I/O to work.
